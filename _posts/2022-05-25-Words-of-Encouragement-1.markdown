Hi JJ,

Thanks for sending me the pics. The website was such a great idea to chronicle their journey.
That beautiful lobby reminded of me of hotels in Peru. The landscape of Yosemite is incredible and J&J are hiking their butts off!!

They are awesome people!!! Love these guys ðŸ’š

Love,
Susy

Thank you for your reponses! They are greatly appreciated. 
Much love to all.

-J&J, Luke
