## Intro
**We are getting married!!** This trip has been so special and it truly is once in a lifetime now.

Because we have this amazing website, we wanted to take time to answer some commonly asked questions since the proposal.

## FAQ:

1. *How did Josh propose?*
  -  While we were packing for our trip, I told Jane to bring one nice outfit so we could go out to dinner around Monterey. As the day came closer, I would subtly hint at the night and time we should go out, how and where we would get ready and what we should do each day to make sure everything was according to my plan. The day of, we drove down and up Big Sur taking many stops along the way. We had the best brunch at Cafe Kevah, saw a bunch of elephant seals on the beach, and visited the Hearst Castle. We got back to our campground at Andrew Molera State Park around 5:30. We got ready in the campground bathrooms (with no mirror) and I hurried to grab the ring box from the glove department while Jane was getting ready. I had to stall a little bit since we got ready too quickly and the proposal time with the photographer was 6:30. Since we were dressed up, I pretended to look for a good place to take pictures before dinner with Jane‚Äôs tripod and I came upon Garrapata State Beach. The timing worked out perfectly and the weather was perfect and it couldn‚Äôt have gone any better. After taking lots of pictures, we got to pop a bottle of champagne and watch the sunset. And even though it was much later than Jane thought it would be, we still had a nice dinner in Monterey that night.

2. *Where did Josh propose?*
  - At Garrapata State Beach in Big Sur, CA. It‚Äôs also the same beach from some scenes in Big Little Lies.

3. *Was Josh nervous?*
  - I was nervous the entire trip until I proposed. So many things had to go right and it is such a big moment and I just couldn‚Äôt get it all out of my head. I was especially nervous the day of and Jane said I was acting weird.

4. *Was Jane surprised?*
  - I was very surprised! I had a few suspicions along the way, but didn‚Äôt think it was actually going to happen. Josh was acting a little funny the day of and especially the moments leading up to the proposal. We hugged when we reached the proposal spot and I was so shocked when he got down on one knee that I don‚Äôt really remember any of it! He planned the perfect proposal and I am so glad he had a photographer capture such a special moment.

5. *When is the wedding?*
  - While we surprisingly have not set a date yet, we are broadly planning on next summer or fall.

6. *Will we have cute invitations or E-invites?*
  - This is our top priority right after the wedding date, but it is still to be determined.

7. *Are we going to elope on our trip?*
