*This post was written on the inaugural release of the site. 5/9/2022*

# Hello! 
Welcome to **Jane & Josh** (a.k.a. Josh & Jane, Jane and Josh, Josh and Jane, Jane 'n Josh, Josh 'n Jane, etc.)

The intent of the site is to be a location where friends and family can easily view pictures and posts from J & J's travels. I personally cannot wait to follow their journey.

I wish you two the best of luck! I know you  will remember this trip for the rest of your lives. We all will be waiting to hear the stories in person when you return.

-Luke
